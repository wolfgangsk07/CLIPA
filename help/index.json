{"01": {"00_title": "Introduction", "01_plain": ["The complexity and heterogeneity of tumor genomes bring an enormous challenge when developing novel molecular therapeutics. These strategies greatly depend on our understanding of the genetic events that are causally implicated in malignancy. Observations from clinical practices indicate that molecular alterations in oncogenome strongly impact the effectiveness of anti-cancer therapies, and dozens of targeted drugs currently ultilized in the clinic or developed in clinical trials have not been linked to specific molecular events. To bridge the gap between the precision medicine and cancer heterogeneity, it is crucial to systematically shape a comprehensive pharmacogenomic landscape of patient-derived cancer models at scale. Recent years have witnessed a rapidly accumulated large-scale drug sensitivity screens and corresponding multi-omics across pan-cancer to chracterize pharmacogenomics, capture the genetic diversity of cancer and identify drug response biomarkers in multiple public databases, including GDSC, DepMap, and NCI60. However, it is still significantly challenging for experimental biologists, especially those without bioinformatic experience, to integrate, explore, analyze, and visualize these large-scale pharmacogenomic profiles.\n", "Therefore, we developed the CLIPA, an interactive, and easy-to-use web server for comprehensively characterizing the landscape of pharmacogenomic interactions and easily visualizing the pharmacogenomic profiles in preclinical cancer models. With just simple clicks through CLIPA, this portal will significantly accelerate data mining in wide tumor biological research areas for biomarker discovery, drug repurposing, and precision treatment. In addition, it could also fill gap between the original large-scale pharmacogenomic data and the delivery of integrated information to terminal users. The outputs from all analyses including tables (csv) and high-resolution figures (pdf, tiff, svg, and eps) can be easily downloaded from CLIPA. \n", "What's more, This website is available freely for all users without any login requirement.\n"]}, "02": {"00_title": "Overview of CLIPA", "01": {"00_title": "Data resources", "01_plain": ["CLIPA is based on multi-omics and drug response screens originated from three public available databases (6 omics, 992 cell lines from 28 cancer types and 173 drugs are available in GDSC; 12 omics, 1773 cell lines from 34 cancer types and 22 drugs are available in DepMap portal; and 8 omics, 60 cell lines from 9 cancer types and 695 drugs are available in NCI60). Detailed clinical and biological features of all cell models, inluding age, gender, ploid, microsatellite status, mutational burden, culture type, culture medium, and so on, were retrieved from Cell Model Passports and DepMap.
